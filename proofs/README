This directory contains the Coq proofs presented in the paper. 
The proofs are split into several files:

- STLC.v (formalization and properties regarding the target language)
- CoherenceBasicBD.v (formalization and all properties regarding our source language - without pairs and without top)
- CoherenceBasicBDPairs.v (formalization and all properties regarding our source language - without top)
- CoherenceSimpleTop.v (formalization and all properties regarding our "naive" source language with top - without pairs)
- CoherenceTop.v (formalization and all proofs regarding our "extend" source language with top - without pairs)

Please note that STLC.v is a dependency required by the other files. 
All the developments were tested using Coq 8.5 and can be built using "coqc <filename> -quick".
